This page has a tabbed interface and shows some additional settings besides just the Minecraft server settings. 

> **Warning:** Deleting the .sqlite database will delete any configured users and settings you have, and will essentially be the same as starting from scratch.

### Crafty Config Tab
Here you can adjust historical data capture and retention settings, as well as the port which Crafty Web runs on.

### Backups Tab
This tab allows you to configure backup settings for Crafty.

### MC Server Tab
This tab allows you to adjust your server start settings.

### Users Tab
The users tab allows you to configure additional users to access the panel and their *role*. Refer the table below for description of each role:

| Role | Permissions |
| ------ | ------ |
| Admin | Full access to everything in the Crafty Web UI. |
| Mod | Access to the Logs page. |
| Backup | Same as the Mod role, but also has the ability to edit the Backup tab in the Config page. |
| Staff | Everything that Backup can do, as well as access to the Schedule page. | 

Currently, the Admin user can not be deleted or changed aside from the password.
